We plan to read through the third chapter of the book about data visualisation.

## Questions for review (answers in the book)

1. What is an **aesthetic**? Name three examples of aesthetic in ggplot2. (section 3.3) 

2. What are **facets**? 
    * Distinguish between facet_wrap() and facet_grid(). (section 3.5)

3. What is a **geom**? (section 3.6)
    * What's the difference between **global** and **local** mapping?

## Questions to ponder (answers in the brain)

1. Distinguish between discrete and continuous data. For these aesthetics, discuss which is suitable for discrete, continuous data, both or neither.
    * size
    * shape
    * colour
    * linetype
    * alpha
    
    Consider: discrete data can be categorial or non-categorial.
    
2. With respect to **geom_point** objects, what is the maximum number of dimensions of our data could be simultaneously represented **within a single ggplot**?
    * Consider we have two axes, various aesthetics and facetting at our disposal.

3. How many colours can the human eye distinguish?

## Interesting discussions 

* Things that doesnâ€™t convey information about a variable, but only changes the appearance of the plot go outside aes. 

* There are many types of geoms to visualise the same dataset, and they can reveal different aspects about it. There are over 30 geoms in ggplot2 summarised in their official [cheatsheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-visualization-2.1.pdf). Also recommended is the [from Data to Viz](https://www.data-to-viz.com/) website. They feature a  [section](https://www.data-to-viz.com/caveats.html) about the caveats of commonly used plots, and how one could work around their pitfalls:
    * **Boxplots** summarise a distribution into several numbers: Q1, median, Q3, etc. However, as described [here](https://www.data-to-viz.com/caveat/boxplot.html), we lose information about the sample size and underlying data distribution.
    * When comparing a pair of observations, the classical **barplots with error bars** can be misleading. This [page](https://www.data-to-viz.com/caveat/error_bar.html) describes how outliers and unequal sample sizes between the compared datasets can lead us to make false conclusions.
